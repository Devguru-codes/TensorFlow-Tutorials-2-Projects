# My TensorFlow Learning Journey: From Fundamentals to Projects

Welcome to my TensorFlow projects repository! This collection of notebooks documents my journey of learning and applying TensorFlow to solve various deep learning problems. My goal here is to practice, solidify my understanding, and showcase my ability to build, train, and evaluate neural networks.

## üåü About This Repository

This isn't just a collection of code; it's a map of my learning path. I started with the basics of TensorFlow and gradually moved towards more complex topics like Computer Vision, Transfer Learning, and Natural Language Processing. Each notebook represents a step forward in my skills and understanding.

## üìö My Learning Path: Notebooks & Concepts

I've organized my work to reflect my learning progression, from foundational concepts to more advanced applications.

### Part 1: TensorFlow Fundamentals
These notebooks cover the core concepts and fundamental building blocks of TensorFlow.
* `intro_to_tf.ipynb`
* `01_tf_fundamentals.ipynb`
* `01_Exercise.ipynb`

### Part 2: Building Neural Networks
Here, I moved on to building and training basic neural networks for regression and classification tasks.
* `02_tf_NN_regression.ipynb`
* `03_tf_NNclass.ipynb`
* `02_tf_exercise.ipynb` & `03_tf_NNclass_Exercise.ipynb` (Practice Exercises)

### Part 3: Computer Vision with CNNs
This section is where I dove into the world of computer vision, learning how to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification.
* `04_t_CV_&_CNN_binary.ipynb` (Binary Image Classification)
* `04.2_tf_CV_&_CNN_multi_class.ipynb` (Multi-class Image Classification)
* `07_Food_Vision.ipynb` (A larger project applying CNNs)
* `04_CNN_exercise.ipynb` (Practice with CNNs)

### Part 4: Advanced Deep Learning Techniques
In these notebooks, I explored more sophisticated techniques to improve model performance and tackle complex problems.
* **Transfer Learning & Fine-Tuning:**
    * `5.tf_transfer_learning_1_F.E.ipynb`
    * `06_tf_TL_Fine_Tuning.ipynb`
* **Scaling Up Models:**
    * `06.TF_TL_Scaling_up.ipynb`
    * `06.1_TF_TL_Scaling_up.ipynb`
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
    * `08_TF_NLP.ipynb`

### Part 5: Additional Exercises
These are various exercises I completed to reinforce my learning across different topics.
* `05_tf_SL_exercise.ipynb`
* `1.ipynb`
* `5_tf_exercise.ipynb`

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Skills Demonstrated
Through these projects, I have gained hands-on experience in:
-   **Deep Learning with TensorFlow & Keras**
-   **Neural Network Architecture Design** (Regression, Classification)
-   **Computer Vision (CNNs)** for image analysis
-   **Transfer Learning** and **Fine-Tuning** pre-trained models
-   **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** basics
-   Data Preprocessing and Augmentation
-   Model Evaluation and Performance Scaling

## üöÄ How to Run These Notebooks

If you'd like to run these notebooks yourself, here's how:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/TensorFlow-Tutorials-2-Projects.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/TensorFlow-Tutorials-2-Projects.git)
    ```
    *(Replace `YourUsername` with your actual GitHub username)*

2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd TensorFlow-Tutorials-2-Projects
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    I recommend using a virtual environment. The main libraries you'll need are:
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter
    ```

4.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    This will open a new tab in your web browser, where you can explore and run the notebooks.
